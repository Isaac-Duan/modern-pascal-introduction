## Why

There's a lot of books and resources about Pascal out there, but too many of them talk about the old Pascal, without classes, units or generics.
// Some of them talk about Pascal before it even had classes. Some of them show classes, as done in Delphi, but fail to mention more modern features, like generics.

So I wrote this quick introduction to what I call *modern Object Pascal*. Most of the programmers using it don't really call it _"modern Object Pascal"_, we just call it  _"our Pascal"_. But when introducing the language, I feel it's important to emphasize that it's a modern, object-oriented language. It evolved a *lot* since the old (Turbo) Pascal that many people learned in schools long time ago. Feature-wise, it's quite similar to C++ or Java or C#.

* It has all the modern features you expect -- classes, units, interfaces, generics...
* It's compiled to a fast, native code,
* It's very type safe,
* High-level but can also be low-level if you need it to be.

It also has excellent, portable and open-source compiler called the _Free Pascal Compiler_, http://freepascal.org/ . And an accompanying IDE (editor, debugger, a library of visual components, form designer) called _Lazarus_ http://lazarus.freepascal.org/ . Myself, I'm the creator of _Castle Game Engine_, http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/ , which is a cool portable 3D and 2D game engine using this language to create games on many platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOSX, Android, iOS, web plugin).

This introduction is mostly directed at programmers who already have experience in other languages. We will not cover here the meanings of some universal concepts, like _"what is a class"_, we'll only show how to do them in Pascal.

## Basics

### "Hello world" program

[source,pascal]
----
{$mode objfpc}{$H+} // Just use this line in all modern sources

program MyProgram; // Save this file as myprogram.lpr
begin
  Writeln('Hello world!');
end.
----

This is a complete program that you can _compile_ and _run_.

* If you use the command-line FPC, just create a new file `myprogram.lpr` and execute `fpc myprogram.lpr`.
* If you use _Lazarus_, create a new project (menu _Project_ -> _New Project_ -> _Simple Program_). Save it as `myprogram` and paste this source code as the main file. Compile using the menu item _Run -> Compile_.
* This is a command-line program, so in either case -- just run the compiled executable from the command-line.

The rest of this article talks about the Object Pascal language, so don't expect to see anything more fancy than the command-line stuff. If you want to see something cool, just create a new GUI project in _Lazarus_ (_Project_ -> _New Project_ -> _Application_).
//Play around, drop some buttons on the form, handle their events (like `OnClick`).
Voila -- a working GUI application, cross-platform, with native look everywhere, using a comfortable visual component library. The _Lazarus_ and _Free Pascal Compiler_ come with lots of ready units for networking, GUI, database, file formats (XML, json, images...), and everything else you may need. I already mentioned my cool _Castle Game Engine_ earlier:)
// The libraries created in other languages (dll, so, dylib) can be easily used from FPC too (and for most of them, you'll find ready "header" units, and even units that wrap them in more modern object-oriented API).

### Functions, procedures, primitive types

[source,pascal]
----
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}

program MyProgram;

procedure MyProcedure(const A: Integer);
begin
  Writeln('A + 10 is: ', A + 10);
end;

function MyFunction(const S: string): string;
begin
  Result := S + ' strings are automatically managed';
end;

var
  X: Single;
begin
  Writeln(MyFunction('Note: '));
  MyProcedure(5);

  // Division using "/" always makes float result, use "div" for integer division
  X := 15 / 5;
  Writeln('X is now: ', X); // scientific notation
  Writeln('X is now: ', X:1:2); // 2 decimal places
end.
----

### Enumerated and ordinal types and sets and constant-length arrays

Enumerated types in Pascal are a powerful, opaque type.

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TAnimalKind = (akDuck, akCat, akDog);
----

The convention is to prefix the enum names with a two-letter shortcut of type name, hence `ak` = shortcut for "Animal Kind". This is a useful convention, since the enum names are in unit (global) namespace, so it's nice to avoid collisions by this `ak` prefix.

Use `Ord(MyAnimalKind)` to forcefully convert enum to int, or typecast `TAnimalKind(MyInteger)` to forcefully convert int to enum. In the latter case, make sure to check first whether `MyInteger` is in good range (0 to `Ord(High(TAnimalKind))`).

Enumerated and ordinal types can be used as array indexes:

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TArrayOfTenStrings = array [0..9] of string;
  TArrayOfTenStrings1Based = array [1..10] of string;

  TMyNumber = 0..9;
  TAlsoArrayOfTenStrings = array [TMyNumber] of string;

  TAnimalKind = (akDuck, akCat, akDog);
  TAnimalNames = array [TAnimalKind] of string;
----

They can also be used to create sets (a bit-fields internally):

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TAnimalKind = (akDuck, akCat, akDog);
  TAnimals = set of TAnimalKind;

var
  A: TAnimals;
begin
  A := [];
  A := [akDuck, akCat];
  A := A + [akDog];
  A := A * [akCat, akDog];
  Include(A, akDuck);
  Exclude(A, akDuck);
end;
----

## Units

Normal programs are saved as `myprogram.lpr` files (`lpr` = Lazarus program file; in Delphi you would use `.dpr`).

Units allow you to group common stuff (anything that can be declared), for usage by other units and programs. They have an interface section, where you declare what is available for other units and programs, and then the implementation. Save units as `myunit.pas`.

[source,pascal]
----
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}
unit MyUnit;
interface

procedure MyProcedure(const A: Integer);
function MyFunction(const S: string): string;

implementation

procedure MyProcedure(const A: Integer);
begin
  Writeln('A + 10 is: ', A + 10);
end;

function MyFunction(const S: string): string;
begin
  Result := S + ' strings are automatically managed';
end;

end.
----

Use a unit by a `uses` keyword:

[source,pascal]
----
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}

program MyProgram;

uses MyUnit;

var
  X: Single;
begin
  Writeln(MyFunction('Note: '));
  MyProcedure(5);
end.
----

## Classes

### Basics

We have classes. At the basic level, a class is just a container for

* _fields_ (which is fancy name for _"a variable inside a class"_),
* _methods_ (which is fancy name for _"a procedure or function inside a class"_),
* and _properties_ (which is a fancy syntax for something that looks like a field, but is in fact a pair of methods to _get_ and _set_ something).
* Actually, you can put <<More stuff inside classes and nested classes>>, more about this in later section.

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TMyClass = class
    MyInt: Integer;
    procedure MyMethod;
  end;

procedure TMyClass.MyMethod;
begin
  Writeln(MyInt + 10);
end;
----

We have inheritance and virtual methods.

[source,pascal]
----
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}

program MyProgram;

uses SysUtils;

type
  TMyClass = class
    MyInt: Integer;
    procedure MyVirtualMethod; virtual;
  end;

  TMyClassDescendant = class(TMyClass)
    procedure MyVirtualMethod; override;
  end;

procedure TMyClass.MyVirtualMethod;
begin
  Writeln('TMyClass shows MyInt + 10: ', MyInt + 10);
end;

procedure TMyClassDescendant.MyVirtualMethod;
begin
  Writeln('TMyClassDescendant shows MyInt + 20: ', MyInt + 20);
end;

var
  C: TMyClass;
begin
  C := TMyClass.Create;
  C.MyVirtualMethod;
  FreeAndNil(C);

  C := TMyClassDescendant.Create;
  C.MyVirtualMethod;
  FreeAndNil(C);
end.
----

By default methods are not virtual, declare them with `virtual` to make them. Overrides must be marked with `override`, otherwise you will get a warning. To hide a method without overriding (usually you don't want to do this, unless you now what you're doing) use `reintroduce`.

### Properties

Properies are a very nice _"syntax sugar"_ to

1. Make something that looks like a field (can be read and set) but underneath is realized by calling a _getter_ and a _setter_ function. A most typical usage is to perform some side-effect each time some value changes.
2. Make somethig that looks like a field, but is read-only. In effect, it's like a constant or a parameter-less function.

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TWebPage = class
  private
    FURL: string;
    FColor: TColor;
    function SetColor(const Value: TColor);
  public
    { No way to set it directly.
      Call the Load method, like Load('http://www.freepascal.org/'),
      to load a page and set this property. }
    property URL: string read FURL;
    property Color: TColor read FColor write SetColor;
    procedure Load(const AnURL: string);
  end;

procedure TWebPage.Load(const AnURL: string);
begin
  FURL := AnURL;
  NetworkingComponent.LoadWebPage(AnURL);
end;

function TWebPage.SetColor(const Value: TColor);
begin
  if FColor <> Value then
  begin
    FColor := Value;
    // for example, cause some update each time value changes
    Repaint;
    // as another example, make sure that some underlying instance,
    // like a "RenderingComponent" (whatever that is),
    // has a synchronized value of Color.
    RenderingComponent.Color := Value;
  end;
end;
----

// { compare with the old value, to shield from making
//   useless assignments to RenderingComponent.Color.
//   This is a common approach to guarantee that setting WebPage.Color
//   many times to the same value will be fast,
//   even if setting RenderingComponent.Color many times to the same value
//   would be slow. }

When declaring a property you specify:

. Whether it can be read, and how: by directly reading a field, or by using a method.
. And, in a similar manner,  whether it can be set, and how: by directly writing to a designated field, or by calling a method.

The compiler checks that the types and parameters of indicated fields / methods match with the property type. For example, to read an `Integer` property you have to either provide an `Integer` field, or a parameter-less method that returns an `Integer`.

There are some good conventions when creating properties. They should be somewhat predictable, like fields:

* The _getter_ function should have no visible side-effects, and be deterministic (no randomization, not even pseudo- :). Reading a property many times should be valid, and return the same value. Note that it's OK for _getter_ to have some _invisible_ side-effect, for example to cache a value of some calculation (known to produce the same results for given instance), to return it faster next time.

* The _setter_ function should always set the requested value. So after `MyClass.MyProperty := 123;` you can expect that always `MyClass.MyProperty = 123`.

These are only conventions, the compiler doesn't prevent you from making something weird using properties. More notes:

* The read-only properties are often used to make some field read-only from the outside. Again, the good convention is to make it behave like a constant, at least constant for this object instance, at least constant for this object instance with this state. The value of the property should not change unexpectedly. Make it a function, not a property, if reading it has a side effect or returns something random!

* The "backing" field of a property is almost always private, since the idea of a property is to encapsulate all outside access to it.

* It's technically possible to make set-only properties, but I have not yet seen a good example of such thing:)

### Interfaces

We have interfaces, much like in Java. They declare the API, without declaring the implementation. A class can implement many interfaces, but it can only have 1 ancestor class.
//This is much like Java, where interfaces are used whenever you think of multiple inheritance.

// TODO example.

### Exceptions

We have exceptions. They can be caught with `try ... except ... end` clauses, and we have finally sections like `try ... finally ... end`.

[source,pascal]
----
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}

program MyProgram;

uses SysUtils;

type
  TMyClass = class
    procedure MyMethod;
  end;

procedure TMyClass.MyMethod;
begin
  if Random > 0.5 then
    raise Exception.Create('Raising an exception!');
end;

var
  C: TMyClass;
begin
  C := TMyClass.Create;
  try
    C.MyMethod;
  finally FreeAndNil(C) end;
end.
----

Note that the `finally` clause is executed even if you exit the block using the `Exit` (from function / procedure / method) or `Break` or `Continue` (from loop body).

### Visibility specifiers

As in all object-oriented languages, we have visibility specifiers to hide fields / methods / properties. By default it's `public`, which means everyone can access it.

The exception is for classes compiled with `{$M+}`, or descendants of classes compiled with `{$M+}`, which includes all descendants of `TPersistent`, which also includes all descendants of `TComponent` (since `TComponent` descends from `TPersistent`). For them, the default visibility specifier is `published`, which is like `public`, but in addition the streaming system knows to handle this.

Not every field and property type is allowed in the `published` section (not every type can be streamed). Just use `public` if you don't care about streaming but want something available to all users.

### Default ancestor

If you don't declare the ancestor type, the `class` inherits from `TObject`.

### Freeing classes

#### Remember to free (release memory) class instances

The classes (instances of the `class` type) have to be manually freed, otherwise you get memory leaks. I advice using FPC `-gl -gh` options to detect memory leaks (see http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/tutorial_optimization.php#section_memory ).

Note that this doesn't concern raised exceptions. Although you do create a class when raising an exception (and it's a perfectly normal class, and you can create your own classes for this purpose too). But this class instance is freed automatically.

#### How to free

To free the class instance, it's best to call `FreeAndNil(A)` on your class instance. It checks whether `A` is `nil`, if not -- calls it's destructor, and sets `A` to `nil`. So calling it many times in a row is not an error.

It is more-or-less a shortcut for

[source,pascal]
----
if A <> nil then
begin
  A.Destroy;
  A := nil'
end;
----

Actually, that's an oversimplification, as `FreeAndNil` does a useful trick and sets the variable `A` to `nil` *before* calling the destructor on a suitable reference.

Often in other code you will also find people using the `A.Free` method, which is like doing

[source,pascal]
----
if A <> nil then
  A.Destroy;
----

Note that in normal circumstances, you should never call a method on an instance which may be `nil`. The `Free` method is an exception here (it does something dirty in the implementation -- namely, checks whether `Self <> nil`).

I advice using `FreeAndNil(A)` always, without exceptions, and never to call directly the `Free` method or `Destroy` destructor. _Castle Game Engine_ does it like that. It provides a nice assertion that _all references are either nil, or point to valid instances_.

#### Automatic freeing

In many situations, the need to free the instance is not much problem. You just write a destructor, that matches a constructor, and deallocates everything that was allocated in constructor (or, more completely, in the whole lifetime of the class). Be careful to only free each thing *once*. Usually it's a good idea to set the freed reference to `nil`, usually it's most comfortable to do it by calling the `FreeAndNil(A)`.

So, like this:

[source,pascal]
----
uses SysUtils;

type
  TGun = class
  end;

  TPlayer = class
    Gun1, Gun2: TGun;
    constructor Create;
    destructor Destroy; override;
  end;

constructor TPlayer.Create;
begin
  inherited;
  Gun1 := TGun.Create;
  Gun2 := TGun.Create;
end;

destructor TPlayer.Destroy;
begin
  FreeAndNil(Gun1);
  FreeAndNil(Gun2);
  inherited;
end;
----

To avoid the need to explicitly free the instance, one can also use the `TComponent` feature of _"ownership"_. An object that is owned will be automatically freed by the owner. It's automatically taken care of to not free an already freed instance this way (so things will also work correct if you manually free the owned object earlier). Be can rewrite previous example like this:

[source,pascal]
----
uses SysUtils, Classes;

type
  TGun = class(TComponent)
  end;

  TPlayer = class(TComponent)
    Gun1, Gun2: TGun;
    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;
  end;

constructor TPlayer.Create(AOwner: TComponent);
begin
  inherited;
  Gun1 := TGun.Create(Self);
  Gun2 := TGun.Create(Self);
end;
----

Note that we need to override a virtual `TComponent` constructor here. So we cannot change the constructor parameters. (Actually, you can -- declare a new constructor with `reintroduce`. But be careful, as some functionality, e.g. streaming, will still use the virtual constructor, so make sure it works right in either case.)

Another approach to automatic freeing is use the `OwnsObjects` functionality (by default already `true`!) of list-classes like `TFPGObjectList` or `TObjectList`. So we could also write:

[source,pascal]
----
uses SysUtils, Classes, FGL;

type
  TGun = class
  end;

  TGunList = specialize TFPGObjectList<TGun>;

  TPlayer = class
    Guns: TGunList;
    Gun1, Gun2: TGun;
    constructor Create;
    destructor Destroy; override;
  end;

constructor TPlayer.Create;
begin
  inherited;
  // Actually, the parameter true (OwnsObjects) is already the default
  Guns := TGunList.Create(true);
  Gun1 := TGun.Create(Self);
  Guns.Add(Gun1);
  Gun2 := TGun.Create(Self);
  Guns.Add(Gun2);
end;

destructor TPlayer.Destroy;
begin
  { We have to take care to free the list.
    It will automatically free it's contents. }
  FreeAndNil(Guns);

  { No need to free the Gun1, Gun2 anymore. It's a nice habit to set to "nil"
    their references now, as we know they are freed. In this simple class,
    with so simple destructor, it's obvious that they cannot be accessed
    anymore -- but doing this pays off in case of larger and more complicated
    destructors.

    Alternatively, we could avoid declaring Gun1 and Gun2,
    and instead use Guns[0] and Guns[1] in own code.
    Or create a function like Gun1 that returns Guns[0]. }
  Gun1 := nil;
  Gun2 := nil;
  inherited;
end;
----

Beware that the list classes "ownership" mechanism is simple, and you will get an error if you free the instance using some other means. Use `Extract` method to remove something from a list without freeing it, thus taking the responsibility to free it yourself.

*In Castle Game Engine*: The descendants of `TX3DNode` have automatic memory management when inserted as children of another `TX3DNode`. The root X3D node, `TX3DRootNode`, is in turn usually owned by `TCastleSceneCore`. Some other things also have a simple ownership mechanism -- look for parameters and properties called `OwnsXxx`.

### private and strict private

The `private` visibility specifier means that the field (or method) in not accessible outside of this class. But it allows an exception: all the code defined _in the same unit_ can break this, and access private fields and methods. A C++ programmer would say that in Pascal _all classes within a single unit are friends_. This is often useful, and doesn't break your encapsulation, since it's limited to a unit.

However, if you create larger units, with many classes (that are not tightly integrated with each other), it's safer to use `strict private`. As you can guess, it means that the field (or method) in not accessible outside of this class -- period. No exceptions.

In a similar manner, there's `protected` visibility (visible to descendants, or friends in the same unit) and `strict protected` (visible to descendants, period).

### Class methods

These are methods you can call having a class reference (`TMyClass`), not necessarily a class instance.

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TEnemy = class
    procedure Kill;
    class procedure KillAll;
  end;

var
  E: TEnemy;
begin
  E := TEnemy.Create;
  try
    E.Kill;
  finally FreeAndNil(E) end;
  TEnemy.KillAll;
end;
----

Note that they can be virtual -- it makes sense, and is sometimes very useful, when combined with <<Class references>>.

Note that a constructor always acts like a class method when called in a normal fashion (`MyInstance := TMyClass.Create(...);`). Although it's possible to also call a constructor from within the class itself, like a normal method, and then it acts like a normal method. This is a useful feature to "chain" constructors, when one constructor (e.g. overloaded to take an integer parameter) does some job, and then calls another constructor (e.g. parameterless).

### More stuff inside classes and nested classes

You can open a section of constants (`const`) or types (`type`) within a class. This way, you can even define a class within a class. The visibility specifiers work as always, so you can the nested class can even be private (not visible to the outside world).

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TMyClass = class
  private
    type
      TInternalClass = class
        Velocity: Single;
        procedure DoSomething;
      end;
    var
    FInternalClass: TInternalClass;
  public
    const
      DefaultVelocity = 100.0;
    constructor Create;
    destructor Destroy; override;
  end;

constructor TMyClass.Create;
begin
  inherited;
  FInternalClass := TInternalClass.Create;
  FInternalClass.Velocity := DefaultVelocity;
  FInternalClass.DoSomething;
end;

destructor TMyClass.Destroy;
begin
  FreeAndNil(FInternalClass);
  inherited;
end;

{ note that method definition is prefixed with
  "TMyClass.TInternalClass" below. }
procedure TMyClass.TInternalClass.DoSomething;
begin
end;
----

### Class references

Class reference allows you to change the class type at runtime, for example to call a class method or constructor without knowing the exact class at compile-time.

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TMyClass = class(TComponent)
  end;

  TMyClass1 = class(TMyClass)
  end;

  TMyClass2 = class(TMyClass)
  end;

  TMyClassRef = class of TMyClass;

var
  C: TMyClass;
  ClassRef: TMyClassRef;
begin
  // Obviously you can do this:

  C := TMyClass.Create(nil); FreeAndNil(C);
  C := TMyClass1.Create(nil); FreeAndNil(C);
  C := TMyClass2.Create(nil); FreeAndNil(C);

  // In addition, using class references, you can also do this:

  ClassRef := TMyClass;
  C := ClassRef.Create(nil); FreeAndNil(C);

  ClassRef := TMyClass1;
  C := ClassRef.Create(nil); FreeAndNil(C);

  ClassRef := TMyClass2;
  C := ClassRef.Create(nil); FreeAndNil(C);
end;
----

Class references can be combined with virtual class methods. This gives a similar effect as using classes with virtual methods -- the actual method to be executed is determined at runtime.

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TMyClass = class(TComponent)
    class procedure DoSomething; virtual; abstract;
  end;

  TMyClass1 = class(TMyClass)
    class procedure DoSomething; override;
  end;

  TMyClass2 = class(TMyClass)
    class procedure DoSomething; override;
  end;

  TMyClassRef = class of TMyClass;

var
  C: TMyClass;
  ClassRef: TMyClassRef;
begin
  ClassRef := TMyClass1;
  ClassRef.DoSomething;

  ClassRef := TMyClass2;
  ClassRef.DoSomething;

  { And this will cause an exception at runtime,
    since DoSomething is abstract in TMyClass. }
  ClassRef := TMyClass;
  ClassRef.DoSomething;
end;
----

// This is an example why compiler cannot detect *all* uses of an abstract
// methods at compile time, in this case --- the error can only resurface
// at runtime.
//
// Poor example actually, since compiler could prevent "ClassRef := TMyClass"
// in this case?

### Class helpers

TODO

### Virtual constructors, destructors

Destructor name is always `Destroy`, it is virtual (since you can call it without knowing the exact class at compile-time) and parameterless.

Constructor name is by convention `Create`.

You can change this name, although be careful with this -- if you define `CreateMy`, always redefine also the name `Create`, otherwise the user can still access the constructor `Create` of the ancestor, bypassing your `CreateMy` constructor.

In the base `TObject` it is not virtual, and when creating descendants you're free to change the parameters. The new constructor will hide the constructor in ancestor (note: don't put here `overload`, unless you want to break it).

In the `TComponent` descendants, you should override it's `constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent);`. For streaming functionality, to create a class without knowing it's type at compile time, having virtual constructors is very useful (see "class references" below).

### An exception in constructor

What happens if an exception happens during a constructor? The line

[source,pascal]
----
X := TMyClass.Create;
----

does not execute to the end in this case, `X` cannot be assigned, so who will cleanup after a partially-constructed class?

The solution of Object Pascal is that, in case an exception occurs within a constructor, then the destructor is called. This is a reason why _your destructor must be robust_, which means it should work in any circumstances, even on half-created class instance. Usually this is easy if you release everything safely, like by `FreeAndNil`.

We also have to depend in such cases that _the memory of the class is guaranteed to be zeroed right before the constructor code is executed_. So we know that at the beginning, all class references are `nil`, all integers are `0` and so on.

So below works without any memory leaks:

[source,pascal]
----
type
  TPlayer = class
    Gun1, Gun2: TGun;
    constructor Create;
    destructor Destroy; override;
  end;

constructor TPlayer.Create;
begin
  inherited;
  Gun1 := TGun.Create;
  raise Exception('Raising an exception from constructor!');
  Gun2 := TGun.Create;
end;

destructor TPlayer.Destroy;
begin
  { in case since the constructor crashed, we can
    have Gun1 <> nil and Gun2 = nil now. Deal with it.
    ...Actually, in this case, FreeAndNil deals with it without
    any additional effort on our side, because FreeAndNil checks
    whether the instance is nil before calling it's destructor. }
  FreeAndNil(Gun1);
  FreeAndNil(Gun2);
  inherited;
end;
----

## Various stuff

### Output, logging

To simply output strings in Pascal, use the `Write` or `Writeln` routine. The latter automatically adds a newline at the end.

This is "magic" routine in Pascal, it takes a variable number of arguments and they can have any type. They are all converted to strings when displaying, with some special syntax for specifying padding and number precision.

[source,pascal]
----
Writeln('Hello world!');
Writeln('You can output an integer: ', 3 * 4);
Writeln('You can pad an integer: ', 666:10);
Writeln('You can output a float: ', Pi:1:4);
----

To explicitly use newline in string, use the `LineEnding` constant (FPC RTL) (_Castle Game Engine_ has also a shorter `NL` constant). Pascal strings to not interpret any special backslash sequences, so writing

[source,pascal]
----
Writeln('One line.\nSecond line.'); // INCORRECT example
----

doesn't work like some of you would think. This will work:

[source,pascal]
----
Writeln('One line.' + LineEnding + 'Second line.');
----

or just this:

[source,pascal]
----
Writeln('One line.');
Writeln('Second line.');

Note that this will only work in _console_ applications. Make sure you have `{$apptype CONSOLE}` (and *not* `{$apptype GUI}`) defined in your main program file. On some operating systems it actually doesn't matter and will work always (Unix), but on some operating systems trying to write something from a GUI application is an error (Windows).

*In Castle Game Engine:* use `WritelnLog`, never `Writeln`. This will be always directed to some useful output. On Unix, standard output. On Windows GUI application, log file. On Android, the _Android logging facility_ (visible when you use `adb logcat`).

### Input/output using streams

Modern programs should use `TStream` class and it's many descendants to do input / output.

[source,pascal]
----
var
  S: TStream;
  A: Integer;
begin
  S := TFileStream.Create('my_binary_file.data');
  try
    S.ReadBuffer(A, SizeOf(A));
    Writeln('Got integer ', A);
  finally FreeAndNil(S) end;
end;
----

It has many useful descendants, like `TFileStream`, `TMemoryStream`, `TStringStream`.

For Castle Game Engine: You should use the `Download` method to create a stream that operates of resources (which includes files, data downloaded from URLs and Android assets). Moreover, to open the resource inside your game data (typically in `data` subdirectory) use the `ApplicationData` function.

[source,pascal]
----
EnableNetwork := true;
S := Download('http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net');
----

[source,pascal]
----
S := Download('file:///home/michalis/my_binary_file.data');
----

[source,pascal]
----

S := Download(ApplicationData('gui/my_image.png'));
----

To read text files, I advice using `TTextReader` class from `CastleClassUtils`. It provides a line-oriented API, and wraps a `TStream` inside. The `TTextReader` constructor can take a ready URL, or you can pass there your custom `TStream` source.

[source,pascal]
----
Text := TTextReader.Create(ApplicationData('my_data.txt'));
while not Text.Eof do
  WritelnLog('NextLine', Text.ReadLine);
----

### Lists

For dynamic-length lists of stuff, we advice using generic classes from the `FGL` or `CastleGenericLists` units. Use `TFPGList` for lists of primitives, `TFPGObjectList` for a list of class instances. Use `CastleGenericLists` and `TGenericStructList` for a list of records or _old-style objects_.

Using these lists is a good idea, as you get type-safety, and their API is rich (there are methods to find, sort, iterate and so on). We discourage using _dynamic arrays_ (`array of X`, `SetLength(X, ...)`) as their API is poor (you can only use `SetLength` and your own type helpers). We discourage using `TList` or `TObjectList` as it will require casting your references from `TObject` to your type.

### Old-style objects

In the old days, Turbo Pascal introduced another syntax for class-like functionality, using the `object` keyword. It's discouraged to use it anymore, except when you want to get the _record with methods_ feature. Then the old-style objects are useful.

Both `record` and `object` do not have to be allocated / freed. A simple `record` or `object` is not a reference (pointer) to something, it's simply the data. This makes them comfortable for small data, where calling allocation / free would be bothersome. It also makes them fast -- a list of such structures is nicely linear in memory, iterating over it doesn't involve jumping over pointers. Also, their memory layout is defined in _some_ situations (packed records, or records with C layout), which makes them suitable to pass to external APIs, like OpenGL.

### Overloading

Methods (and global functions and procedures) with the same name are allowed, as long as they have different parameters. At compile time, the compiler detects which one you want to use, knowing the parameters you pass.

By default, the overloading uses the FPC approach, which means that all the methods in given namespace (a class or a unit) are equal, and hide the other methods in namespaces with less priority. For example, if you define a class with methods `Foo(Integer)` and `Foo(string)`, and it descends from a class with method `Foo(Float)`, then the users of your new class will not be able to access the method `Foo(Float)` easily (they still can --- if they typecast the class to it's ancestor type). To overcome this, use the `overload` keyword.
